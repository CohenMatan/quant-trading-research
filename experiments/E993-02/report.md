# E993-02 — X993 v1.1 (infrastructure)

P7-CP3R SCORE / MECHANICS EXPORT with the corrected revenue baseline (infrastructure, non-trading, D173): identical to E993-01 (frozen score v1, 84 month-end reviews 2011-01..2017-12, 325 weekly checks, data-v1 universe) except that the YoY revenue baseline is the company's PIT revenue True TTM recorded live at the review 12 months earlier for EVERY company in the PIT store (same security life, same SEC registrant, every component quarter usable by then), SEC-repaired securities fed whenever a further filing becomes usable; audit bits for the CP3 eligible-only rule, rescued rows with the reason they were outside the universe a year earlier, a deterministic dates-only sample for SEC checks; alternate share classes scored for the held-class rule. NO orders, NO returns, NO performance; nothing after 2017-12-31.
